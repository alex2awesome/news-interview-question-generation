        mr. jeff obafemi carr (actor, playwright): i came close to running out of luck, when i almost fell down a well - or was it a cesspool? i'm still not sure. 
chideya: today's weekly snapshot comes from actor and playwright jeff obafemi carr. he says if you ever happen to stumble and fall, the biggest trip could be who comes to your rescue? 
mr. jeff obafemi carr (actor, playwright): i bought a house in the neighborhood i grew up in, near my widowed mother who still resides in my childhood home. i was lucky to buy it at a good price years ago. you see, we live in an inner city, speedily gentrifying community with increasing mignons of hip, progressive, urban pioneering neighbors. i just love the new politically correct terms for yuppies who decide that these little black neighborhoods have the cutest little cottages. all they need is for people to move into them that can give them the love, attention and exponentially increasing property values their presence alone can bring. these watchful neighbors then patrol the old hood with their cell phones handy. if they see something that just isn't right, they call up the codes department, anonymously of course, and cry foul. so a couple of weeks ago, my mom's hot water heater gave up the ghost and flooded the basement as a memorial. yours truly drew the task of pulling 40 years of accumulated memories out of the basement to get to the flooding and save the day. well, what do you know? one of the ever-vigilant friendly neighborhood preservationist saw the pile by the basement door and reported my mother's home as the site of a public dump. welcome to america. luckily, i'd already ordered a dumpster unbeknownst to the good neighbors, so i sped up its delivery, charged the ipod, put on my favorite work jeans and started attacking memory mountain one little bit at a time. mom was going to help, but i told her i had it covered. i was jamming to the soundtrack of (unintelligible). happy thoughts was sailing as i stepped into the mini mountain with my right foot. that's when it happened. i hadn't looked where i was stepping. if i had, i would have remembered i was directly over a hole in the ground my dad put a piece of wood over. and that was a good temporary fix, but i should mention that my dad passed away six years ago. well, mix the way the five feet of junk, seven or eight years of rot, a fresh rain and a primary weight of a 6'2, 190-pound brother man on a size 13 boot, and what do you have - every bit of that mix headed two directions at blinding speed, forward and down. instinct may be reached to both sides. and with a mix of luck and skill, i was able to catch myself just as i felt cold water rising up almost to my knee. there was no bottom. i said, whoa, out loud, then i had another thought. wait a minute, is this a well or a sewer? oh, crap - an unintentional pun. i pulled myself up as one of the tenants was singing some italian aria in my ears. my foot and leg were covered with something wet and black. i immediately ran and grabbed the garden hose, sprayed off my boot and pants' leg, and thank god, my mom wasn't helping me out because it could have been her. as i stripped and prepped the washer for my clothes, i thought to myself that if i would have fallen in, all i could have done was scream for one of my neighbors to come and rescue me. i wonder if they would have come. and if they did, would they have said, hmm, promise you'll repaint in earth tones, preserve the subway tile in your bathroom and restore the original glass doorknobs in your hallway, and we'll pull you right out of there, neighbor. i guess i'm thankful i wasn't in that position this time because i would have been sol -surely out of luck. 
chideya: jeff obafemi carr is an actor, playwright and co-host of the radio show "freestyle." he lives in nashville, tennessee.

        farai chideya, host: i'm farai chideya and this is news & notes. before the break, we heard from a mother with aids. she has been getting great support from her family. but that is not always the case. dorothy holmes is a psychologist in miami. she has been working with people infected with hiv and their families for several years now. hello. 
dr. dorothy holmes (psychologist; national president, association of black psychologists): hello. how are you doing today? 
farai chideya, host: i am doing great. so, we just heard from carla. she waited to tell her kids and family about her illness. so let's start off with disclosure. when is the right time to really reveal the illness to others if you have hiv or aids? 
dr. dorothy holmes (psychologist; national president, association of black psychologists): well, disclosure is based on a needed-to-know, and that need to know starts with, of course, the individual's sexual partner. however, when it comes to disclosing some of your status to your children, there's no black and white answer or yes or no in terms of when to or when not to disclose. it depends on several factors, which include - some of these factors include the age of the child, child's emotional maturity, the child's intellectual and the child's intellectual functioning. and - but before disclosure takes place, my recommendation is that the infected person, of course, meets with a mental health professional who has experience in this particular field. 
farai chideya, host: so when you, as a psychologist, deal with individuals who have a diagnosis of hiv or aids, what are some of the most common questions that come up in your sessions? 
dr. dorothy holmes (psychologist; national president, association of black psychologists): disclosure is typically the first issue. do i need to tell my children? is, (unintelligible) the children or younger than 15 or 14, parents are probably concerned about their longevity in terms of whether they'll be, whether or not they will be available or be around to see their children grow up, finish high school, become functional adults themselves. so they really want to know when and how do i let my children know, or if i let - should i let my children know. 
farai chideya, host: do you ever see people who react in ways that are completely unhealthy? drug abuse or recklessness or acting out with anger? 
dr. dorothy holmes (psychologist; national president, association of black psychologists): yes, in terms of not disclosing their status to… 
farai chideya, host: well, after they have had… 
dr. dorothy holmes (psychologist; national president, association of black psychologists): …the partner. 
farai chideya, host: after they've had a diagnosis. 
dr. dorothy holmes (psychologist; national president, association of black psychologists): after they've had a diagnosis, yes. unfortunately, unfortunately, that is the case for some people. because of their anger and rage, they do act out inappropriately and not disclose their status to a sexual partner. 
farai chideya, host: now… 
dr. dorothy holmes (psychologist; national president, association of black psychologists): and that causes the incidents to - of hiv/aids to increase. 
farai chideya, host: yeah. i was just going to ask you about that because we heard earlier in the show how rampant aids has become among african-americans in the washington, d.c. area particularly, but obviously, there are plenty of places where there's just a huge increase. and when you think about this idea of telling someone, there have been all these campaigns to ask people to open up. but do you think that's really working? 
dr. dorothy holmes (psychologist; national president, association of black psychologists): well, again, the issue of social stigma, shame, guilt, lack of education and knowledge are some of the factors that prevent individuals from disclosing their status. one of the things that must be readdressed was the need for information and education and that's our first line of defense. once we educate ourselves, then we're able to protect ourselves. 
farai chideya, host: carla bailey has been living with aids for 13 years. there are people who've been living with aids for over two decades. but if, in fact, your loved one has aids and it's becoming a nearing of the end, what

        madeleine brand, host: this is day to day. i'm madeleine brand. 
alex cohen, host: and i'm alex cohen. tomatoes grown in at least 20 states have been given a clean bill of health. that's to say they are not associated with the salmonella outbreak, which has made more than 150 people sick. but even though tomatoes from top-producing states like california and florida are considered safe, many consumers are feeling a bit squeamish about buying any. tom deardorff is a fourth-generation tomato farmer in oxnard, california, and he's on the line with us now.  welcome to the program and tell us, how big of a year is this for you - for your crops? 
mr. tom deardorff (deardorff family farms, oxnard california): well, we are setting up to have a very positive year based on what's happened over the last couple of years. starting production in about two weeks and hoping for the best. 
alex cohen, host: hoping for the best, but expecting what? how is the salmonella outbreak going to affect you, do you think? 
mr. tom deardorff (deardorff family farms, oxnard california): well, it's obviously substantially changed the marketplace in a very short period of time. what looked like was going to be a very positive season could end up being a disaster if certain buyers in both retail and food-service industry continue to not offer them on their menu items. 
alex cohen, host: and i have to say, you know, tomatoes don't necessarily have a great track record. there have been more than a dozen outbreaks of contamination with tomatoes since 1990. so how do you, as a farmer, go about convincing people it's ok to eat this stuff? 
mr. tom deardorff (deardorff family farms, oxnard california): well, they actually have a very good track record in california and from a food-safety standpoint, we are the leading producers of the safest, best supply of tomatoes. so, it's a matter of educating the consuming public about where their tomatoes are coming from and about the measures that have been implemented in the last 10 to 15 years to help increase the food-safety elements of our products. 
alex cohen, host: even though tomatoes here in california are considered safe, i'm wondering if you've taken any additional safety precautions with your crops. 
mr. tom deardorff (deardorff family farms, oxnard california): yeah. food safety is obviously an evolving thing, and we continue to implement new measures every year. this year, for example, we've substantially altered a lot of our packing shed in pursuit of better food- safety measures and more wash stations and more critical control-point analysis of the product as it moves through our packing shed. 
alex cohen, host: you know, i hear you talking about this, and i trust what you're saying is right. but i've got to say, you are not with me at the store when i look at the tomatoes, and i have to say, i've looked at them in the past couple of days and thought, i don't know. it feels just a little bit weird. so how do you go about convincing people when you can't be there for every, you know, individual potential buyer? 
mr. tom deardorff (deardorff family farms, oxnard california): and consumer confidence is a very finicky thing and we've seen with prior problems with food-safety issues, it's usually an initial huge reaction, and then it takes six to nine to sometimes 12 months to regain that consumer confidence. we are hoping that this time, because the domestic food supply has been cleared and has been recognized as not being a part of any of these warnings, that hopefully that recovery time is much quicker. we're going to need a lot of help from the government to help us get that message out. we are going to need a lot of help from our industry marketing associations. and then as individual companies, we need to get out there and educate the public about all the food-safety measures that we do here in our domestic food supply to ensure the safety of our products. 
alex cohen, host: worse-case scenario, how much might you lose? 
mr. tom deardorff (deardorff family farms, oxnard california): well, worst case is a really bad picture. california is the leading producer of tomatoes and if we have to start disking under fields, the ramifications are going to be into the hundreds of millions, if not billions of dollars. so, it could

        farai chideya, host: from npr news, this is news & notes. i'm farai chideya. if you take a hard look at america's mortgage crisis, there seems to be some good news. last week, mortgage rates dipped to a sixth-month low, but will that help americans at risk of losing their homes? will it even help the economy at large? for more, we've got keith reed, economics reporter for the cincinnati enquirer. keith, welcome. 
mr. keith reed (economics reporter, cincinnati enquirer): how's it going? 
farai chideya, host: it's going great. so the numbers, 30-year fixed-rate mortgages dropped a little bit. they were 6.24 percent last month. now, to a six-month low of 6.20 percent. that doesn't sound like very much, so why is it making economists happy? 
mr. keith reed (economics reporter, cincinnati enquirer): oh, it's making economists happy because it does reflect a little bit of what they've said that we need to see to try to bring some of the housing market back. i mean, one of the things that - one of the major factors that conspired to due to the housing market what it's been doing, is the fact that the rates have gone up. if you remember, much of what happened in the housing market over the last several years was due to the fact that we have rates that would have historical lows. and people began to buy homes and take out interest only or adjustable rate mortgages that were based on these very low rates. when those rates reset at higher levels, people - that's when you started to see people defaulting on their homes, and you started to see from the credit crunch some people in the mortgage market drying up. people weren't able to go out and borrow as much as they had been or they weren't able to borrow at all. so when you start to see some loosening in that in terms of the rates readjusting downward, then economists are going to be a little bit happy about that. 
farai chideya, host: but, if you're at risk of losing your home, if you're trying to get refinancing, for example, will this save you? 
mr. keith reed (economics reporter, cincinnati enquirer): no, it won't, it likely won't. i mean - the problem with someone who's in a mortgage right now who wants to refi out of it is that in many instances, they are trying to refi out of a mortgage on a house that's basically worth more than they can - than the house can be sold for - excuse me, worth less that house can be sold for. for example, say you bought a house three years ago, and your interest - your adjustable rate mortgage had an initial rate that was set at, say, 4 percent for three years. well, today, that mortgage would obviously - the rate would be much higher than that initial 4 percent. but then the other piece of it is, if the house was worth $150,000 three years ago, today it may only be worth, say, $120,000, or $110,000. so when you got to refinance that house, you really have no equity in it at all, and that's the problem that people are facing when they want to refi out of these mortgages. so it's not something that's really helping people that already own their homes or are already in a mortgage and want to get out of one, just because it was a bad mortgage and they can no longer afford it. what it may do is help loosen up credit for some people who want to buy - who hadn't been able to in the last four to six months. 
farai chideya, host: so it should help you if you're a new homeowner or seeking to be a new homeowner? 
mr. keith reed (economics reporter, cincinnati enquirer): it could help you. i mean, provided you qualify, provided you meet all the qualifications to get a mortgage. and it's much more difficult to do that now than it was, say, a year ago. but if you do qualify, it makes a little bit easier for you, at least in terms of what you would pay on a monthly basis because the rates are lower than it had been in several months. and that's good news for people who were trying to buy now. 
farai chideya, host: of course, the mortgage crisis is having a huge impact on the economy at large. another thing that always
