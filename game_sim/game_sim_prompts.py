    You're generally {response_type}. Choose whether you want to respond to the question, and then give your repsonse. Respond with {response_type}:
    '''
    return prompt
    # plug in the info_items
    # for response type you might really need to define what each means
    # make sure the source profile isn't just 100% being evasive, or confused, that's not useful. We want to make sure it's realistic, even if that means we do some rule-based behaviors. maybe we want some set of frequency of specified behavior - eg. response_type = evasive --> 40% evasive, 60% straightforward.
    # i.e youre super anxious, you will only respond honestly after a lot of acknowledgment, etc.
