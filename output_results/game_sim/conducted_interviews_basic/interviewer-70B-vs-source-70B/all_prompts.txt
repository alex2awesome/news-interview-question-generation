Information item #1: The U.S. intelligence report presented to President-elect Trump states that Russia's president, Vladimir Putin, personally ordered a campaign to hurt Hillary Clinton during the U.S. presidential campaign and to try to help Donald Trump win the election.

Information item #2: The Russian government's response to the report is that it's "more of the same, nothing new" and that the report provided no evidence, with the goal of undermining the legitimacy of Trump's election.

Information item #3: Putin has previously responded to these charges, mocking the idea that Russia could have thrown a U.S. election and suggesting that the Democrats are sore losers.

Information item #4: The Russian government is not concerned about the allegations, and Putin may even see them as a positive development, as they make Russia seem more powerful and influential on the world stage.

Information item #5: Many Russians believe that their country is the victim of a Western conspiracy, and that Russia is simply giving the West "a taste of its own medicine" by allegedly interfering in the U.S. election.

Information item #6: The report is not a major concern in Moscow, and most people are focused on the upcoming inauguration of Donald Trump.

    Here are the key pieces of information provided by the interviewee, Bill Dudley, former President of the New York Federal Reserve:

Information item #1: The economy is growing above trend pace, with job growth of 150,000-200,000 a month, which is higher than what's sustainable in the long run.

Information item #2: The Fed will likely continue to raise interest rates, as the economy is growing and financial conditions are still very accommodative.

Information item #3: The neutral rate is probably higher than where we are right now, but it's not a precise number, and the Fed needs to curtail monetary policy further.

Information item #4: The dot-plot is just a forecast and should not be taken as a commitment; it's subject to change as new information becomes available.

Information item #5: The stock market will likely face tougher going in 2019, with slower earnings growth and higher interest rates.

Information item #6: The economy's capacity to continue growing is a concern, as there aren't enough workers to sustain above-trend growth for more than another year or so.

Information item #7: There is always a recession risk, but it's difficult to predict when it will occur.

Information item #8: The trade policies of the Trump administration are a wild card, and the outcome is uncertain; a more open and free trading system would be beneficial, but retaliation and higher trade barriers would be bad.

Information item #9: The fiscal trajectory of the US is a concern, with a high budget deficit and rising debt service costs, which could lead to a bleak fiscal outlook over the next 5-10 years.

Information item #10: Financial regulation is another concern, particularly in the non-banking part of the financial system, where there are holes in the regulatory regime and risks could build up.

Information item #2: Germany's leaders agreed to monetary integration to avoid dominating Europe with the Deutschmark and to address concerns from other European countries, particularly France.

Information item #5: A collapse of the euro would have significant consequences, including a potential chain reaction of countries leaving the eurozone, which could ultimately lead to Germany returning to the Deutschmark.

Information item #6: There is no provision for a country leaving the eurozone, and the market consequences of such an event are unknown.

Information item #7: The economist believes that the eurozone cannot simply "muddle through" the crisis and that more European integration and pooling of sovereignty are necessary to overcome the crisis.

Information item #1: Hillary Clinton's plan to deal with the housing crisis includes protecting servicers against legal liability if they enter into renegotiation of loans.

Information item #2: Robert Rubin supports Barney Frank's proposal to increase the number of loans that get renegotiated, and also suggests that amending the bankruptcy law to allow primary residences to have their mortgages renegotiated within the context of bankruptcy law could be a sensible solution.

Information item #3: Rubin believes that it is possible to find a solution for people in negative equity situations, where the value of their house is less than the loan they took out to buy it, by writing down the amount of debt to match the value of the house and allowing the family to remain in the house with a renegotiated mortgage.

Information item #4: Rubin suggests that public funds may be needed to make this solution work, but not to make up the difference between what the lender initially lent and what they're willing to scale the loan down to, as the lender should suffer a loss.

Information item #5: The decline of home prices is significant for the economy, as it affects consumption, investor psychology, and credit-extending institutions.

Information item #2: Dr. Greg Thomas and his team used CT scanning to image 52 mummies at the Cairo Museum and found evidence of vascular disease, atherosclerosis, in many of their large and small arteries.

Information item #3: The team's hypothesis was that calcium deposits in the arteries would still be present 3,000 years later, allowing them to detect atherosclerosis in the mummies.

Information item #4: The mummies studied were chosen because of their age, with the team looking for older mummies, including a general and a princess.

Information item #5: The princess, who died around 1550 B.C. at the age of 40, was found to have severe atherosclerosis, despite likely having a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and grains, and being physically active.

Information item #6: The discovery of atherosclerosis in ancient Egyptians suggests that there may be unknown risk factors for heart disease, beyond the currently recognized factors such as high blood pressure, smoking, and inactivity.

Information item #7: The research team suspects that atherosclerosis may have been common among the general population, not just the elite, but further research is needed to confirm this.

Information item #8: The team hopes to study mummies from the middle class in future expeditions to gain a more complete understanding of heart disease in ancient Egypt.

Information item #4: The decision is considered risky, as parts of the military council may be unhappy and could potentially rebel against Morsi's move.

Information item #5: Despite the risks, the move strengthens Morsi's hand, making him a completely empowered president with full responsibility for the state.

Information item #6: The new defense minister and chief of staff have already been sworn in, and the decision was made in coordination with at least part of the military council.

Information item #7: Morsi's move marks a significant shift in the military-civilian balance of power in the government, with the country now having a civilian-led government for the first time.

    Here are the key pieces of information extracted from the interview transcript:

Information item #1: The North Carolina 9th Congressional District election is still disputed due to allegations of fraud and misconduct, with Republican Mark Harris leading Democrat Dan McCready in an unofficial tally.

Information item #2: Investigators are accusing a campaign operative, McCrae Dowless, of running an illegal absentee ballot scheme, paying people to register voters and collect ballots, which is illegal in North Carolina.

Information item #3: The state board of elections is investigating whether Dowless turned in all the ballots he collected or if they were manipulated in any way, with suspicious numbers in the county where Dowless worked tilting towards Harris.

Information item #4: A key witness, Lisa Britt, Dowless' former stepdaughter, testified that Dowless paid people to pick up ballots and that she even filled out some ballots for down-ballot races for people who left them blank.

Information item #5: Britt also alleged that Dowless tried to interfere in the state's investigation, reaching out to her as recently as last week and trying to tell her what to say at the hearing.

Information item #6: A new election is a possibility, and the state board needs to come to a bipartisan agreement to either hold a new election or certify Harris; if they don't, Harris will be automatically certified, but the certification will go to the U.S. House to approve or deem the seat vacant.

Information item #7: If a new election is called, Harris would be allowed to run again, but would need to go through a new primary election, which could be challenging given the controversy surrounding him.

Information item #8: The case highlights concerns about vote-by-mail ballots, which are becoming more popular in the US, and may have implications for national elections in the future.

Information item #1: The stolen data contains 26.5 million Social Security numbers belonging to the nation's veterans.

Information item #2: The thief may not know the value of the stolen data, but if they do, they can sell it on the black market for a profit.

Information item #4: Sophisticated criminal groups can use the stolen data to commit identity fraud, identity theft, and even target military personnel and their dependents for terrorist activities or espionage.

Information item #5: The stolen data could also be used by foreign intelligence agencies to target individuals with access to classified information or to gain access to military bases.

Information item #6: It may take weeks or months to turn the stolen data into new identities, so the fact that nothing has been reported yet does not necessarily mean the data has not been used.
