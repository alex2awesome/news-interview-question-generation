This type of question seeks to ensure that information is correct and reliable.\n - Topic-Transition Question:\n   - Definition: Shifts the conversation from one subject to another.

Can revealing biases and insights.\n - Challenge Question:\n   - Definition: Tests the interviewee's position, argument, or credibility. These questions are often used to provoke thought, debate, or to highlight inconsistencies.\n - Broadening Question:\n   - Definition: To expand the scope of the discussion, encouraging the interviewee to think about the topic in a broader context or from different perspectives.\n\n\n      \nThe format of your response should be in this sequence:\n  1.

Can you explain how your work in Aleppo changed your career?\n  Response:\n  It appears that Syria is a new topic, since the interview is shifting.\n  [Topic-Transition Question]\n\n\n  Question: Do you believe the current administration is handling the pandemic well?\n  Response:\n  The question appears to be asking for an opinion rather than a set of facts.\n  [Opinion/Speculation Question]\n\n\n  Can you provide evidence to support that claim?\n  Response:\n  The journalist is asking for further details specifically to back up a previous remark.\n  [Verification Question]\n\n\n      Now it's your turn.\n\n      Below is the following interview transcript:\n      \nSCOTT SIMON, HOST: The U.S. intelligence report presented to President-elect Trump on Friday says that Russia's president, Vladimir Putin, personally ordered a campaign to hurt Hillary Clinton during the U.S. presidential campaign and to try to help Donald Trump win the election. We're going to turn now to our Moscow correspondent Lucian Kim. Lucian, thanks for being with us. \nLUCIAN KIM, BYLINE: Sure thing, Scott. \nSCOTT SIMON, HOST: The report was published when it was nighttime in Moscow. What's the reaction been today? \nLUCIAN KIM, BYLINE: Well, the first thing to know is that it's a Russian Orthodox Christmas today, so it's a holiday. Putin celebrated the holiday in an ancient monastery near St. Petersburg. And then he met some local fishermen for a cup of tea. As for state television, they did report on this news. They said it's more of the same, nothing new. The main goal is to undermine the legitimacy of Trump's election and that the report provided no evidence. It should be said that Putin has responded to these charges in the past at a press conference a couple of weeks ago. And he really mocked the idea that Russia could have thrown a U.S. election. He said, basically, the Democrats are sore losers and that the information leaked was much more important than how it got out. \nSCOTT SIMON, HOST: Lucian, help us understand, are charges like these potentially damaging, or is there an element of pride that they're even accused? \nLUCIAN KIM, BYLINE: Yeah. I mean, I don't think they're damaging at all. I think Putin can be quite happy with these results. He had a real problem two years ago after the intervention in Ukraine. Western powers were ignoring and isolating Russia. Obama called the country a regional power. And today, Putin is deciding war and peace in Syria. And, you know, he's being attributed with powers of influencing a U.S. election. So, in some ways, it makes Russia seem much bigger than it really is. One thing to keep in mind is that Russians have been told, for some time, that they're at war with the West, not really a shooting war but an information war, sort of a struggle for influence. So there's a widespread perception here that Russia is, itself, the victim of a Western conspiracy. So I think you can say, from the Kremlin's perspective, Russia's just giving the West a taste of its own medicine. More broadly speaking, I think this report really doesn't matter very much here in Moscow. People here are waiting for the inauguration of Donald Trump and nothing else really matters. \nSCOTT SIMON, HOST: NPR's Moscow correspondent Lucian Kim, thanks so much for being with us. \nLUCIAN KIM, BYLINE: Thank you.\n\n      Here is the question from the transcript I want you to classify using the taxonomy: \n      Question: The U.S. intelligence report presented to President-elect Trump on Friday says that Russia's president, Vladimir Putin, personally ordered a campaign to hurt Hillary Clinton during the U.S. presidential campaign and to try to help Donald Trump win the election.
