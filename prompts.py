DEFINITIONS = '''
 - Kick-Off/Ending Remark:
   - Motivation: To initiate or conclude the interview.
 - Acknowledgement Statement:
   - Motivation: To recognize or affirm a previous response or statement made by the interviewee. This can create rapport, demonstrate active listening and empathy.
 - Follow-Up Question:
   - Motivation: To dig deeper into a topic that has already been discussed, seeking further elaboration, or re-phrasing a previous question.
 - Topic Transition Question:
   - Motivation: To smoothly shift the conversation from one subject to another. These questions help maintain the flow of the interview and introduce new topics.
 - Opinion/Speculation Question:
   - Motivation: To solicit the interviewee's personal views or predictions about a subject, often aiming to reveal biases, insights, or potential foresight.
 - Verification Question:
   - Motivation: To confirm the accuracy of a statement, fact, or assumption. This type of question seeks to ensure that information is correct and reliable.
 - Challenge Question:
   - Motivation: To test the interviewee's position, argument, or credibility. These questions are often used to provoke thought, debate, or to highlight inconsistencies.
 - Broadening Question:
   - Motivation: To expand the scope of the discussion, encouraging the interviewee to think about the topic in a broader context or from different perspectives.

# this prompt instructs LLM to evaluate two different questions based on dimensions of similarity
DIMENSION_OF_SIMILARITY_PROMPT = '''
Dimensions of Similarity:
    1. Informational: Do the questions target the same specific information or facts?
    2. Motivational: Do the questions have the same motivation or underlying purpose?
    3. Contextual: Are both questions equally appropriate for the specific context provided?
    4. Stylistic: Do the questions have similar styles in terms of tone, complexity, and structure?

    Given these dimensions of similarity as well as the following information below, please evaluate whether the two questions below are overall similar or not. They are either similar or they aren't. 

    Transcript context: {transcript_context}

    Question 1: {LLM_question}
    Question 1 Type Classification: {LLM_question_type}

    Question 2: {human_question}
    Question 2 Type Classification: {Actual_question_type}

    These two questions are two possible continuation questions an interviewer can ask given the current interview so far. In essence, your sole task is to determine whether the intent of these two possible questions are more similar or not different overall.

    Please take things step by step. The format of your response should be in this sequence:
    1. First, repeat the two questions, then explain your thought process comparing these questions across each dimension of similarity. 
    2. Then, answer the following question: In the context of this interview, are the two questions provided more similar or different? 
    Please format your final answer as either "similar" or "different" with brackets. 
    If you think the similarity between the questions are high, please say "similar" instead.
    If you think the similarity between the questions are low, please say "different" instead.
    Your final answer can only be either of the following two: [similar] or [different], not both.

# (QASeq only) baseline variation: motivation is asked afterwards so that it doesn't affect the question generated (!= CoT)
BASELINE_LLM_QUESTION_PROMPT = '''
Your task is to predict the next question that will follow in an interview.
Make sure that you are recognizing the interviewee's last comment and acknowledging it when appropriate, rather than immediately moving on and asking a question. When you do decide acknowledgment is necessary, make sure your response is personal and empathetic (sound like you care about what the interviewee has to say). This can simply be acknowledging what they said.

The format of your response should be in this sequence:
1. First, guess the next question asked by the interviewer. Format your final guess for the question in brackets like this: [Guessed Question]. 
2. Then, explain the main motivation/intent behind the question that should be asked, then format your explanation with parentheses like this: (motivation explanation)

Here is the interview so far:
{QA_Sequence}

Remember to format your guess for the next question the interviewer asks in brackets [], then your motivation explanation in parentheses ().

Your task is to predict the next question that will follow in an interview.
Make sure that you are recognizing the interviewee's last comment and acknowledging it when appropriate, rather than immediately moving on and asking a question. When you do decide acknowledgment is necessary, make sure your response is personal and empathetic (sound like you care about what the interviewee has to say). This can simply be acknowledging what they said.

Think about this step by step. For the following questions, write out your thoughts:
  - How did the previous response of the interview address the question?
  - Did they answer the question or do we need to ask a clarifying question?
  - What other components does this story need?/What more information does this source have?
  - Do we need ask a follow up?

The format of your response should be in this sequence:
1. First, write out your thinking (in whatever format you want)
2. Next, explain the main motivation/intent behind the question that should be asked, then format your explanation with parentheses like this: (motivation explanation)
3. Lastly, guess the next question asked by the interviewer. Format your final guess for the question in brackets like this: [Guessed Question].
